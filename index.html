      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p class="abstract">
        Robotic systems are increasingly used in scientific exploration, but their opaque decision-making processes hinder interpretability, limiting human understanding and trust in human-robot collaboration. To address this, explainability must be integrated into interactive human-robot interaction (HRI) systems, especially for non-roboticist scientists. This work presents ‘XAIgent’, a multi-agent system (MAS)-based framework designed to support interactive and explainable HRI in scientific exploration. By decomposing robotic decision-making into modular, agent-based components, XAIgent provides more interpretable and adaptive explanations than monolithic approaches. Our approach guides the integration of explainability into robotic assistants to accelerate scientific discovery. We outline key principles for designing interactive systems that allow scientists to query a robot’s actions, understand its reasoning and errors in real-time, intervene when necessary, and explore its functionalities to enhance transparency and control by demonstrating a simulated scientific environment created in Unity, accompanied by a preliminary user study evaluating the system’s effectiveness.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="conclusion">
        This work presents a multi-agent approach for explainable HRI, shifting robots from monolithic to
        modular designs and showing early gains in user understanding, trust and usability.
      </p>
        
      <p>Future work includes comparative studies with monolithic HRI systems, integration of
        physiological sensing and automated LLM based evaluation of explanation quality. We also aim to
        deploy the system on a real robot in a laboratory environment.
